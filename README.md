# Project Name: Veggy Party whoop whoop

## About:

Create a link between farmers and customers with an online platform that remove intermediary who takes most of the money in the process.

## How does it work:

This application would display various farmers around a given location and allow the user to buy fresh and seasonal food.

#### Farmer:

- create a profil: photos, biography, informations about his farm etc..
- create a stock: add new item or remove the sold one 
2. Login / out & keep info of stock (local storage?)


#### User:

1. Create an account: name, address, payment method...
2. Login / out & keep info of cart (local storage?)
3. Access a page with local farmers, display their profil and products when selected (remove and add item to cart...)
4. Delivery?

## Benefits:

- Reasoned diet (saisonal food)
